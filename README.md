## Contributing

Please report any errors to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/narimiran/nim-basics/issues).

Pull requests are welcome, but before making (significant) changes, please open an issue so it can be discussed what is the best way to tackle the specific problem.

After making the changes, make sure to build new web and epub versions:
```bash
make
```

If you just want to see the changes, while working on a significant refactoring, you can just build web version, as it is much faster:
```bash
make web
```
